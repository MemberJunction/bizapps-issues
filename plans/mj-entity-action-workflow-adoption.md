## 1. What is changing in MJ core

`EntityAction` — MJ's generalized hook for running an Action off an entity's
create / update / delete / validate — is becoming the **workflow-hook substrate for every app on
the platform**, so no app needs to invent its own.

It already does more than its schema suggests, and this is worth knowing regardless of this PR:

| Invocation | Where it fires | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `Validate` | `OnValidateBeforeSave` | **A real blocking gate** — a non-`Success` result fails the save |
| `Before*` | `OnBeforeSaveExecute` | Awaited, result discarded (cannot veto) |
| `After*` | `OnAfterSaveExecute` | Fire-and-forget |

And because **`Execute Agent` is just an Action**, any binding can already run an agent — a
deterministic **flow agent** (visual editor, `Action`/`Prompt`/`Sub-Agent`/`ForEach`/`While` steps,
per-step retry and error behaviour) or a **loop agent** where judgement is genuinely needed. The
house shape is a flow agent with a `Sub-Agent` step calling a loop agent.

**What #3408 adds:**

- **`EntityAction.ScopeEntityID` + `ScopeRecordID`** — bind a workflow to *one configuration record*
  rather than to every record of an entity. This is the important one: it means **no app ever grows
  a column per type per event**, and a configuration record can surface "the workflows bound to me"
  as a real relationship instead of something buried in filter code.
- **`EntityAction.Sequence`** — deterministic ordering when several bindings share an event.
- **`EntityActionParam.ValueType = 'Entity Object Data'`** — passes `entity.GetAll()` instead of the
  live `BaseEntity`. Use it for anything that serializes, above all `Execute Agent`'s `Data` payload:
  a `BaseEntity` serializes to `{}` because its fields are getters, so the agent silently receives
  an empty payload with no error anywhere.
- Two seeded reusable `ActionFilter`s — **"field changed"** and **"field changed *to* value"** — so
  transition detection stops being hand-rolled. Without them `AfterUpdate` fires on *every* update,
  and "status *is* X" instead of "status *changed to* X" re-fires on every later save.
- `After*` routed through `QueueManager` so failures are durable and retryable rather than logged
  and swallowed.

**Authoring is pure metadata** — `metadata/entity-actions/`, with `relatedEntities` for invocations,
filters and params. No schema and no code in the consuming app.

## 2. What this means for BizApps Issues

Issue tracking is close to the canonical use case: a record moves through states, and each
transition should be able to trigger something an administrator configured — escalate, notify,
assign, ask an agent to triage or summarize.

Scope binding fits because issue *types* differ: a security report, a billing dispute and a feature
request warrant different handling, and today that difference has nowhere to live but code.

## 3. Suggested bindings

| Entity + invocation | Scope | Work | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Issue · `AfterCreate` | an issue **type** | Flow agent | Triage — classify, set severity, route, acknowledge the reporter |
| Issue · `AfterUpdate` (status changed) | an issue type | Action or flow agent | Stage notifications, SLA clock, escalation |
| Issue · `AfterUpdate` (priority raised) | an issue type | Action | Page the on-call owner |
| Issue · `Validate` | an issue type | Action | Refuse closure without a resolution code or required fields |

## 4. Notes specific to this repo

**Triage is the strongest agent case in this app.** A loop agent reading an inbound issue and
proposing classification, severity and owner is genuinely judgement-shaped work — and the
recommended shape applies: a **flow** agent for the deterministic spine (acknowledge → classify →
route → notify) with a **`Sub-Agent`** step calling the loop agent for the classification itself.
That keeps the audit trail deterministic while putting the judgement where it belongs.

**SLA timers want the queue.** Once `After*` is routed through `QueueManager` (#3408 §4.4), a
binding that schedules follow-up work has a durable, retryable home rather than a dropped promise.
Until then, treat time-based escalation as a scheduled job, not a save hook.

**Watch the notification volume.** Issues change status often, and a binding without a "changed
**to** value" filter will fire on every save. The seeded transition filters exist for exactly this.

## 5. What to do now

**Nothing.** This is a tracking doc so the idea is not lost and so this repo's plans reflect where
workflow hooks are going. When #3408 merges and its engine work lands:

1. Confirm the bindings in §3 are still the right ones.
2. Author them as metadata under `metadata/entity-actions/`.
3. Build the flow agents they dispatch to.
4. Delete this file, or fold it into the repo's main plan.

## 6. Two rules to carry into the design

- **Synchronous bindings should be Actions, never agents.** `Validate` and `Before*` run inside the
  caller's transaction. A loop agent's duration is unbounded and holding a transaction open for it
  is not acceptable. Agents belong on `After*`, which is async.
- **A flow agent should create human work and finish** — it should not hold a run open waiting for
  a person. Use `MJ: AI Agent Requests` when the answer resumes the same run (minutes to hours), and
  a **bizapps-tasks** Task when it is durable, assignable work someone owns (days to weeks).
